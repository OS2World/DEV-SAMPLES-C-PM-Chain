# DEV-SAMPLES-Chain
Chain.  A Cellular Automata program.  (A.K Dewdney's chain). This program is modeled after a Cellular Automata program I read about in Scientific American in the computer recreations article. I do not remember what issue, late 89 I think, but any follower of A.K Dewdney will no doubt reconize this "CHAIN" program.
